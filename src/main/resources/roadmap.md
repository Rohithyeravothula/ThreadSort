ThreadSort library provides multi-threaded sorting 
algorithms.

1) ThreadMergeSort
2) ThreadQuickSort
3) ThreadTimSort
4) ThreadSort

It is possible that thread-based sorting might not be 
a userful approach in your use case, so the library also 
provides a benchmarking suit to compare the algorithms 
performance on your data.


Aim:
performance comparison
force 1 thread performance
force multi-thread performance 
force auto multi-thread performance 

techniques:

* sort and merge
